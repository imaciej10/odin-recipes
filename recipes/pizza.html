    <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>Margherita pizza is an Italian specialty that originated in Naples. This pizza is protected in Italy, meaning it must be prepared in a specific way to bear the “pizza Margherita” label, and the Italian government certifies bakeries that make it. This pizza is extremely simple, focusing on fresh, wholesome ingredients and high-quality bread dough. It is also the foundation for many pizzas served around the world; most people can get a local pizza place, and cooks can make it at home.</p>
        <p>Garlic is frequently used in Margherita pizza. Traditional Neapolitan pizza is made with a dough made of flour, salt, and yeast. The dough is mixed, kneaded, and formed into rounds before being covered in toppings of the cook’s choice and baked in a high-temperature oven. The high temperature causes the dough to become very crispy; some Italians prefer theirs almost burnt, and it sears the toppings. The pizza is ready for slicing, serving, and eating after only a few minutes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>112-inch round of pizza dough, stretched</li>
            <li>3tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2¾ounces fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>4 to 5basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn heat to its highest setting. Let it heat for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>Put the sauce in the center of the stretched dough and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the surface, stopping approximately ½ inch from the edges.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Scatter basil leaves over the top.</li>
            <li>Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone or tiles in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, approximately 4 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a food processor, whiz together whole, drained canned tomatoes, a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Keep leftover sauce refrigerated.</li>
        </ol>
